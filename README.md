 Home-automation
A simple IoT project using the ESP8266 (NodeMCU / ESP-12F) to control home devices - lights, fans, or small motors — from any device connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

You can toggle relays (or MOSFETs) through a built-in web page that displays the real-time ON/OFF status of each connected appliance.

Features

Web-based control panel: Access through your browser (no app needed).

Wi-Fi control: Use your local Wi-Fi network.

Multiple devices: Control up to 3 outputs (2 lights + 1 motor/propeller).

1* single channel Relay.
Live state updates: The web page updates button labels depending on each GPIO’s state.

Local control: Works even without internet - only requires local Wi-Fi.

Components Required
ESP8266 (NodeMCU or ESP-12F)	1	Main microcontroller with Wi-Fi
Relay Module (1 channel) To switch AC/DC loads
LED indicators or small motors	As needed	Represent lights/fan/propeller
 7.4 V battery power supply	1	For motor
